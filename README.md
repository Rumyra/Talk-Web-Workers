## Slides

I don't upload my slides due to some problems I've had with copyright infringement (As in people taking my slides ðŸ˜¢).

However, you can find all the slides within the talk in the [index file]() within this build. It's just an HTML file so pretty easy to navigate - all my slide notes are there as well, within the markup.

For each conference I branch, so just choose the correct branch for the correct index (no two talks are the same).

## Get in touch

I tend to talk about new web technologies, Audio, MIDI and/or real time visuals, (all still using web tech). I either do this stand-a-lone or as part of the [{ Live : JS } collective](http://livejs.network/), where we also provide workshops, installations and shows.
